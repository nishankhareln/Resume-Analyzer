 Google suggests switching to a different model, such as gemini-1.5-flash,

 model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')


In this solution, a PDF resume is uploaded and processed by 
converting the first page into an image using pdf2image, and 
then extracting the text from the image with the help of Tesseract OCR 
(pytesseract).
The text is analyzed to identify specific skills such as Python, Data Science, SQL, etc., 
using regular expressions. If any skills are missing from the resume, the system suggests online resources
(such as courses or tutorials) that the user can explore to learn those skills. Additionally, 
the resume is evaluated against a provided job description using the Google Gemini model to
generate a professional assessment of how well the resume aligns with the job requirements. 
This process not only helps users improve.
